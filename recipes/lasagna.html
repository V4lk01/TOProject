    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is an amazingly tasty vegetables lasagna my mom learned to cook at work!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded pecorino or Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed in cleasn towel for excess moisture</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the mushrooms:
            Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8 quart) sauté pan on high or medium-high heat. Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak.<br>
            Sprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called "dry sautéing.)
            Once the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.</li>
